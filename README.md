## Overview

 - The goal of the Note Taker app is to allow the user to **write** AND **save** notes on this webpage. We are given the front-end code and need to set up the back-end to get the webpage running. 
 - The home page must link to the notes.html page with the "Get Started" button.
 - On the notes page the user is presented with pre-existing notes in the left-hand column, and empty fields to enter in a new note (with a new title) in the right-hand column.
 - After the user enters a new note *title* and then *text* and click the save button, the new note appears at the bottom of the list in the left-hand column. And they can clear these two areas to create a new note with the *plus* button located next to the save button on the top right-hand side
 - When an old note is clicked on, it appears in the right-hand column and the text is visible.

 **Back-end Files added to begin Homework**
 1. The first file I added was the *server.js* file to the main *NOTE-TAKER* folder. 
 2. Then I created the *routes* folder to hold my *apiRoutes.js* and *htmlRoutes.js* files. 
 3. I also added a file called *middleware.js* in the *db* (database) file.
